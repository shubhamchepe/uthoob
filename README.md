<p align="center"><strong>Distraction-Free App for Android</strong></p>

<p align="center">
  Uthoob is a remarkable React Native Android application designed to provide a distraction-free video watching experience. Unlike other video platforms, Uthoob does not play ads within the app, allowing users to focus on their selected content without interruptions. With its minimalistic and user-friendly interface, Uthoob promotes a seamless and immersive video consumption experience.

  One of the standout features of Uthoob is its ability to prioritize subscriptions and display only the content from subscribed channels. By filtering out unrelated videos, Uthoob ensures that users are presented with content that aligns with their interests and preferences. This feature enables users to stay focused and reduces the temptation of exploring unrelated videos that can divert attention.

  To enhance the study and concentration environment, Uthoob offers a unique background study music playing feature. Users can select from a collection of calming and instrumental tracks that provide a soothing audio backdrop while watching videos. This feature aims to create a conducive atmosphere for learning, working, or studying, helping users maintain their focus and productivity.

  In addition to its distraction-free video playback and study music features, Uthoob incorporates a convenient to-do list functionality. After each video watched, the app automatically triggers the to-do list feature, reminding users of their pending tasks and ensuring that important responsibilities are not overlooked. This integration promotes a seamless transition from video consumption to task management, making Uthoob a valuable productivity tool for users.

  Uthoob is built with a strong emphasis on user experience, striving to provide an uncluttered and focused video-watching environment. By eliminating ads, filtering content, and incorporating productivity features like background study music and the to-do list, Uthoob empowers users to maximize their time and maintain their concentration on what matters most to them. Whether it's for educational purposes, work-related tasks, or personal development, Uthoob is an ideal companion for anyone seeking a distraction-free video watching experience.
